B7, 1: Tested Wordle-algoritm

Create a solution & algoritm for two problems. 
Practice TDD to implement the two algoritms.

A. Check which letters in a guessed word that match the letters 
of the correct word. Also check if the index of the letters matches.
Output is an array with an object for each letter & status. 

B. Pick a random selected word from a list. 
Check if it has a specified length & if the letters exists more than
once or not. 
Output is the selected word or something optional if the word does not exists.
